# ITP216-Applied-Python
Course Description
This course focuses on development of practical Python programming skills through project-based application. It is
split into two parts: part one focuses on powerful features of the Python programming language itself (“Pythonic”
programming), which allow students to quickly and easily manipulate data in ways not found in other languages.
Part two focuses on application of modules to solve domain-specific challenges, such as in scientific computation
and data visualization, system manipulation and automation, web development, and machine learning.
Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students should be able to:
● Understand “Pythonic” programming techniques
● Create a computational-thinking-based plan for solving a programming challenge
● Implement a solution to a programming challenge
● Evaluate the effectiveness of a program
● Generate, organize, analyze, and interpret data in a variety of domain-specific settings
